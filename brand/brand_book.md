# GRR Brand Book

## Brand Identity

**Name:** GRR  
**Full Name:** Gather. Rest. Rise.  
**Core Value:** Balance — fitness, family, hard work, intentional rest  
**Positioning:** Premium lifestyle apparel for those who refuse to choose between crushing goals and being present

---

## Brand Story

Two places shaped us:

**Wilmington, NC** — Early morning paddle-outs. Sunset dinners on the porch with family.

**Austin, TX** — Dawn gym sessions. Building something meaningful. Home for dinner with the people who matter.

**For those who refuse to choose.**

Crush your goals AND be present. Fitness fuels. Rest sharpens. Family grounds.

## The Three Pillars

### GATHER
Bring together what matters most. Family. Friends. Community. This is your fuel.

### REST
Recovery isn't weakness. It's strategy. Your best work comes after intentional rest.

### RISE
Show up stronger. Every single day. In the gym. At work. For your family.

## Who We Serve

**The Active Parent** — Early gym sessions before the house wakes up. Quality time matters as much as quality reps.

**The Coastal Texan** — Beach roots, Texas pride. Fewer things, better things. Authenticity over trends.

**The Balanced Builder** — Building a career AND a life. Burnout isn't a badge. Success includes health and family.

## Geographic Roots

*Two roots, one identity.*
